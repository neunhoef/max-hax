= *Max hax* - a blog on all things related to computers

:ghpages: https://neunhoef.github.io/max-hax

On this blog I publish interesting things about computers that I stumble
upon. My personal interests cover but are not limited to

* *Databases*, in particular https://arangodb.com[ArangoDB], of which I am
  one of the main developers and architects.
* *Linux*, which I use exclusively for my computers at the moment.
* *C/C++*, which is the programming language I use most these days
* *Performance*, in particular of algorithms and implementations on
  multi-core and multi-host systems
* etc.
