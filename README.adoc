This page was written in *AsciiDoc*, converted to *HTML/PDF* using
*Travis CI, Asciidoctor and Docker* and published via *gh-pages*. 

This means I can simply write in *AsciiDoc*, commit in *git* and be done.

* Asciidoctor Demo file:
** {link-demo-adoc}[AsciiDoc source file]
** {link-demo-html}[HTML output file]
** {link-demo-pdf}[PDF output file]

This blog post describes the workflow used to do it:
